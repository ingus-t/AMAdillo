", answer: "For the 60 Days of Udacity Challenge, the goal is to help you progress through your Foundations Course so we just ask that the time be spent on Lessons in your coursework. If by chance you finish your Course before the 60 days is up, then you are definitely welcome to use that time to work on other related items.

I’m ok to continue with this too, just would like to ask ", answer: "Hey guys! We know that you might find the need to change your Slack Display Name during the course of the scholarship and therefore we have been asking for your email address as well as your full names in all the forms so that we can find you in case you have changed your display name! So no issues if you change the display name, but I will recommend that you don’t change it often or rather make any changes now itself as the community will soon start to recognise you with your display name. Also, in case you have decided on what changes you are making to your display name and want us to have it reflected on the #60daysofudacity wall and in other forms then let us know through a DM! " },{question: "How many days is #60daysofudacity Cloud Track - Honorable Mentions Wall running behind - any estimate? I know it will be updated soon still how many days is avg wait time!

" },{question: "Are there going to be job opportunities after this course? ", answer: "We can’t guarantee any job opportunities, but I strongly believe what you learn in this scholarship program will be valuable. Try leveraging it in your resumes and job interviews! " },{question: "Can I create separate study groups in the cloud channel? ", answer: "Yes indeed! When the Study Groups program is launched, we’ll provide instructions on how to formally register your group and request a Slack channel. " },{question: "What’s involved with being a student leader? ", answer: "Student Leaders will be responsible for working within a smaller team to manage one of the public Slack channels here in this workspace. This means answering questions as well as coming up with activities that will help your classmates complete their Foundations Course as well as build community! No experience is necessary to apply. " },{question: "Do we need Python for the 1st Phase of the Cloud track or just for the 2nd Phase of the program? ", answer: "1st phase doesn’t include any project. You can make your hands dirty with python if you don’t know it. " },{question: "What is the best studying speed? I feel like I neither want to be the fastest not the slowest in the course ", answer: "3-5 hours is a general rule of thumb, but you can take longer or shorter depending on your familiarity with the material! We have quite a bit of time in the scholarship, it’s ok to have a slow and steady pace! " },{question: "How can we create study Groups in slack? ", answer: "We will be floating the forms next week where you can fill in your requests for Study Groups in Slack and we will create them for you! " },{question: "Please solve the zoom max limit. So that everyone can attend live zoom sessions. ", answer: "I’m afraid the limit is set by Zoom and not something we can adjust!

If you haven’t watched the recording yet, it’s up on our Google site now " },{question: "Does it matter if we complete the course within the first week or after 2 months, will it be a deciding factor for being selected for stage two? ", answer: "Remember this is a journey, not a race. Take the time to really absorb and fully comprehend the course material so that you are prepared if you are selected for Phase 2. Along with the way, reinforce your learnings by helping others here in this community - we all want to get to the finish line together! " },{question: "Is it necessary to take part in the classroom every day until March 2021 or based on our convenience? ", answer: "It is flexible but try to be consistent with your learning and your Slack activity. This can only help you in the long run " },{question: "Are we going to have the 50 days challenge this time too? ", answer: "see the Google Site for dates https://sites.google.com/udacity.com/bertelsmann-tech-scholarship/community " },{question: "I saw a few people posting that they can not create an Azure account in their region. I think an alternate solution to this would be helpful to members. ", answer: "Thank you to everyone for bringing this to our attention. is looking into this and will let everyone know once she has more information. " },{question: "I will be spending 3 hours a day, Monday through Wednesday on my studies. For the "60 days of Udacity", that seems to indicate that I will have to at least login to Udacity on each of the remaining days to reach that goal. Is that right? ", answer: "You must study consistently for 60 days any "course-related material" It does not necessarily have to do with the foundation course because you might finish that before 60 days " },{question: "How does the 60-day challenge work? ", answer: "60 Days of Udacity is an initiative where you pledge to study your course material for 30 minutes consecutively for 60 days. You’ll post your daily updates in the 60DaysofUdacity channel when it’s launched. This challenge is going to be rolled out within the next two weeks, so make sure to keep an eye out on #announcements " },{question: "Does anyone have any clues as to what the "Optional Project" is that was mentioned in the Cloud Orientation? ", answer: "The Optional Project is the one found in Lesson 5 (called Deploy an Article CMS to Azure). As Grace mentioned, this project is taken directly from the Nanodegree program. It’s optional for you now because it’s only when you’re in the Nanodegree program that you will formally complete it and submit it for review. I hope this helps! " },{question: "Can I know what will be the minimum prerequisites for getting started with this course? ", answer: "Check out this slide (16) in the Orientation deck that states the suggested prerequisites for this track as well as links to free Udacity courses you can check out to supplement your learning! https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1T3IJZphPET_sHY9ArsHjBBLXYbGK3SwYiRTagxNBEBQ/edit#slide=id.gaf3c26433f_0_0 " },{question: "Will there be a course completion percentage (eg. 30% of all students finish the course) per track by 3/15/21? ", answer: "Of course, we are always striving for the highest completion %s we can get. If you all can surpass the Cloud track from last night, that would be incredible! That completion rate was 38%!!! " },{question: "Will it be fine to work 30 min a day on the course and 15 mins of dedicated activity on slack during a weekday since I’m a full-time employee and I can dedicate much time on weekends ", answer: "That sounds like a great schedule to me, as long as you’re consistent with your learning and Slack/community participation, you’re destined for success " },{question: "DO we have all 3 track students in this slack? is it not separate for all 3? ", answer: "Each track has its own separate workspace so you’ll only find students in the Cloud track here " },{question: "Do we have any LinkedIn group or anything similar with alumni from this program? ", answer: "We don’t have any for this particular track, but all Scholarship students are given access to our Udacity Alumni Facebook group once the scholarship ends! " },{question: "Hey Team, will there be any Technical AMA’s anytime in the future through Phase 1? ", answer: "We don’t have any planned at the moment, but if you or your classmates would like to host one, I am not at all opposed to it! " },{question: "Hi, just curious, why stage 1 doesn’t end with any kind of project submission? ", answer: "Great question! During this Challenge phase, the goal is to give you the Foundational skills so that you will be able to complete a project. Phase 2 is where you’ll actually create one and then formally submit it to our team of project reviewers who will review and evaluate each project and determine whether it has passed. " },{question: "Is it possible for Udacity to give badges to the graduates of the 1st part of the program even if they are not selected for the 2nd part? (To share it on LinkedIn) ", answer: "you would have already received a badge for being the Bertelsmann Scholarship Recipient! You can showcase this on your LinkedIn to highlight your experience of the program! For the completion of the foundation course (Phase 1), there is no associated certificate as such and therefore no separate badges too but during the course of Phase 1, you will find many other badges that you can collect and add to your professional profiles as part of your Phase 1 experience (and achievements!) " },{question: "Based on orientation, we do not have to submit the project? ", answer: "Attempting the project is optional but no one will be able to submit it even if they attempt it. That said, this is the exact same project in the Nanodegree program that will be awarded so you will have the advantage of having it ready to formally submit if you are indeed selected for Phase 2 " },{question: "Are there any other scholarship programs being planned or supported by other big tech companies? ", answer: "It seems there’s always something in the works! If you haven’t yet, definitely subscribe to be alerted when the next program is announced! https://www.udacity.com/scholarships " },{question: "Is there any possibility of adding new course content for phase 1? ", answer: "Glad to see you here. Unfortunately, we won’t be adding new content for Phase 1.

We’ll let you know when it’s done " },{question: "if we post something …it is likely that …that particular post is posted earlier …so if that same post is posted again by some other scholar then will it be considered as a slack participation? ", answer: "We know that it is unlikely to always know if a certain question has already been posted and answered! So what we would suggest is just do a quick search and if you aren’t fining the question, it is perfectly fine to post it on the workspace " },{question: "Are projects related to this foundation course optional or not? As everyone has no credit card and are students right now ", answer: "The projects are optional! We’re currently looking into workarounds for creating an Azure account so you all can follow along with the exercises " },{question: "I have a question related to the phase_1 course, is it mandatory to complete the project to be part of the phase_2 ? ", answer: "The project is completely optional! The benefit of completing is that should you be accepted into Phase 2, you’ll be ready to submit your project " },{question: "Is it mandatory to complete and finish a project in phase 1 in order to be eligible for Phase 2 of scholarship? ", answer: "watching all the videos and completing all the quizzes are mandatory but completing the project is optional! " },{question: "Do I need people(colleagues) behind me in order to create a study group or a good idea is enough? ", answer: "A good idea is enough! Students will surely join " },{question: "After, downloading a lesson and watching it offline, how do you measure the time spent on the platform? Or is it unnecessary? ", answer: "Time spent on Udacity is not measures, Slack participation is measured in which Quality matters more than Quantity, also please make sure you don’t miss any quizzes if you are downloading lectures and doing them " },{question: "Do answering colleagues’ questions in AMA sessions counts as community participation? ", answer: "As long as your response is adding context to the existing discussion, yes it will be taken into account! " },{question: "Does it matter how quickly you can finish the course? Cause I noticed that some people are already done. ", answer: "there is no advantage of finishing early! We encourage you to go at your own pace, and really learn with the community! As long as you finish by March 15th, 2021, that’s all that matters! " },{question: "Are we going to check some list that we have been active through the 60 days challenge or you can see that from your side. Does following other udacity courses correlated with this scholarship in some way count ", answer: "As part of the challenge you will have to make a daily post in the #60daysofUdacity Channel (upcoming!) about what you worked on that particular day! Regarding other courses, we would recommend that you start first with the Foundation Course itself and once you have completed and reinforced the learnings from this course, you can always follow other related courses, papers, books and post about your learnings from them as part of the Challenge " },{question: "Any suggestions for working professionals being part of this scholarship, who also work for getting into phase 2? ", answer: "From my experience, I would recommend: Setting a schedule and sticking to it! As a working professional, block out time for not only being here on Slack but for also going through your Foundations Course. Even if it’s just 30 minutes per day as your fellow students have suggested above! Don’t be too hard on yourself! There will be times when you don’t get the material and that’s OK. Step away from it a bit and come back later Rely on your classmates and give back as well! This is an extraordinary experience to be in a global community where there is literally someone online 24/7 to help you or give you an encouraging word! Don’t be shy in relying on your classmates to help you through this Challenge. We promise, it will make the experience so much more rewarding!! Adding on!! Very key!!! 4. Try to participate in as many of the community-organized events and challenges as possible! As we expressed during Orientation, these count toward Community Participation the most " },{question: "I have been asking a lot of questions on slack and not able to answer much as I am a beginner. I will just share if I find something important. Will it affect my contribution ? ", answer: "Sharing resources on Slack and asking questions is a way to contribute! " },{question: "I have completed lesson 2 using sandbox in order to keep the 200$ balance untouched. Is it ok?? ", answer: "that’s totally ok! Feel free to explore other methods. If you were able to somehow bypass not entering a CC number when creating your Azure account and you don’t have a .edu email, please let me know how you did it! This would help so many folks who can’t create an account due to no access to a credit card. " },{question: "I read somewhere that after completing the course and the scholarship end, we can’t access the course anymore. Why not give full access so I can return when I need ? ", answer: "This time around, we’re using the first module in our paid Nanodegree programs, so we’ll have to make the lessons private once the scholarship ends. Like Ali said, you can download resources if you want to go back " },{question: "Whether we can get access to udacity career resources? ", answer: "For Phase 1 of the scholarship, you won’t be able to access the Career Resources but you can always look into the career orientated courses made available by Udacity! And ofcourse students moving into Phase 2 of the scholarship will have access to the career resources! " },{question: "I do not see more serious questions so lets ask something stupid If you are active on slack, what are the chances (in percentage) to pass this phase? ", answer: "As we only look at two things: 100% course completion and consistent community participation, I would say that the odds are really in your favor! I know you asked for numbers, but this is the closest thing you’ll get from us " },{question: "how do we propose community events? Also, any plan for a showcase/hackathon? ", answer: "You can use - https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScr7BX9TFpbf8KT5UTE-vb_L1aL8Iwicn1GNhPZrQG94JqDXw/viewform to submit your ideas/plans for any community initiatives! This is also available under the ’Forms & Links’ section of the Cloud Track Tab on the google site! We are planning an event similar to the project showcase, but you can always supply us with more ideas and of course you can plan hackathons for the community! Some of the past scholarship students actually had organised hackathons in their respective communities and their peers found the hackathons to be quite engaging! " },{question: "Will the 2nd phase of the program prepare the followers for the Microsoft Certification Exams? In other words will there be any specific lessons for certification exams? ", answer: "The syllabus is not dedicated to a particular certification exam but it might be aligned to one or more of Azure Certifications. To be sure about this you can go through the detailed syllabus of the Developer for Microsoft Azure ND here: https://www.udacity.com/course/developer-for-microsoft-azure-nanodegree--nd081 You can also try posting this in #tech_help or #general_discussion to see if any of your peers who have cleared one or more such certifications can help you better with this question! " },{question: "I saw something related to mentorship at the end of the program. Will that be from the group itself or someone from outside ", answer: "It will be within the group! We’ll have students who are finished with the course towards the mid-to-end of the program, so we wanted to pair them with folks who are still at the earlier stages of the course. This is a voluntary program so not everyone needs to participate " },{question: "One mentor for one person (like a buddy), or one mentor for multiple persons (in mentorship program) ", answer: "The format will be dependent on the number of mentors available and the volume of scholars who would like to be mentored! " },{question: "Can we submit more applications if we have a bunch of ideas for a group creation? ", answer: "Of Course you can! " },{question: "Should you prove your progress in 60dayschallenge or just share what you have done literally? ", answer: "You’ll see the instructions when the program is launched tomorrow but to give you a preview, you’ll share a very brief (e.g 1-2 sentence) update every day in a dedicated slack channel as a way of holding yourself accountable! For example :D1 of D60 - Completed Lesson 4. Learned how to < > 10 Dec AMA " },{question: "I had a doubt in 60 days: should we just post for 30 min or post the whole we have done also? ", answer: "We just want a short summary (a sentence or two) of what you did! If you want to go in depth or cite your sources you can, but it’s not a requirement " },{question: "How are the 30 minutes calculated in the 60 days of Udacity challenge? ", answer: "it’s completely by the honor system :slightly_smiling_face: There’s no way for us to track how much time you put into the course per day and even if we did, we wouldn’t be able to count the time you used to look at other sites and articles for supplemental learning! Try not to think too hard about it! We’re just looking for you to dedicate at least 30 minutes to your Foundations course! " },{question: "Hi, maybe this is not a question. Do you have any tips for us that have different times that really far, sometimes happened in the early morning? Currently I am working. I hope I can join sometimes. ", answer: "We totally understand that the AMA sessions aren’t taking place in a time that works for everyone. This is a completely optional event that is here as a resource to clarify any doubts you have about the scholarship program! If you have a question outside AMA hours, you can both Palak and I in the channel or DM us so we can help you " },{question: "Can I use a different id for accessing Azure resources for this course (including projects) because my udacity’s id is different from that of my Azure id. ", answer: "That’s totally fine, we just need your Slack email and your Udacity email to match, that’s it! " },{question: "Will we be allowed to pick our mentor when the time is right or will our mentor be picked for us? Or do they have a say in who they want to mentor? ", answer: "You will have a pool of peers from this scholarship who will have completed the course and will be then volunteering to be the mentors! When the initiative is floated, we will try our best to have it in a way such that you and other scholars are able to pick their mentors based on time zone and geo! " },{question: "is it necessary to skill up with Azure Foundation course only; will only that count in 60days challenge? or any AI or other coding work, research paper will also count? ", answer: "Of Course you can also skill up with other resources but we would recommend that you reserve initial days to thoroughly go to the foundation course. And once you have gone through the course, you can focus more upon other resources to reinforce the learnings from the course and even move further deeper in the world of Cloud! " },{question: "Will there be some future sessions with Microsoft Azure Developers? during our Phase1 ", answer: "Unfortunately, we won’t have a technical webinar with Microsoft Azure Developers during this scholarship " },{question: "What is the Polly app? ", answer: "It’s an add-on app in Slack that you can use to create quick polls! Try it out by using the /polly command " },{question: "On what basis will student leaders be picked? ", answer: "We’re solely looking at the strength of the application! We want students to take their time filling it out and by being thorough in their answers. For #tech_help leaders, we want students to have some technical experience " },{question: "Are we good to create study groups based on the level of expertise ? ", answer: "Yes, You can also create study groups based on specific academic interests or projects you want to take up with a group! " },{question: "What is the criteria to allow us to create study groups? ", answer: "Hey Andrés! We will be creating all the study groups that you guys request for unless only if a very similar group has already been requested. In that case too we will let you know about that! " },{question: "how can i join a study group, someone invite me or i look for the available one? ", answer: "we didn’t roll this program out yet! On Monday, you’ll know exactly how to start and join a Study Group channel! Look out for an announcement then " },{question: "Do #tech_help leaders get "extra credit" as opposed to other leaders? ", answer: "Nope, we are expecting the same amount of efforts from all the Student Leaders! " },{question: "By what time will we know if we have made it to the 2nd phase? ", answer: "We’ll be notifying everyone within 2 weeks after Phase 1 ends 14 Dec AMA " },{question: "Study groups will have student leaders based on selection, right ? ", answer: "We don’t have student leaders for study groups, we request that the organizer for each group step up to a leader position!

We’re not looking at your technical expertise or if you’re finished with the course (unless it’s for the lesson channels and #tech_help) " },{question: "How many mentors will be available in the 2nd phase of the cloud track? ", answer: "I don’t have an exact number, but our mentor community is huge! You’ll have project mentors as well as mentors within Knowledge to answer any technical question you have " },{question: "If I’m done with the challenger project within the first few days of #60daysofudacity, what’s the recommended next step learning path to fill the rest of the days? ", answer: "We don’t have a set learning path for students who are done with the course, but I would recommend that you dive deeper into the concepts related to Cloud that you find interesting. Try working on a project with others who are done with the course as well! " },{question: "Is there any reward to complete #60daysofudacity ", answer: "you’ll receive a star next to your name to signify the completion of your pledge and you’ll rack up community participation! Most of all, through this challenge you’ll have made studying a habit " },{question: "Do student leaders have more chances for winning phase 2 than others? ", answer: "Definitely not! At the end of the day, we only look at Course Completion and Community Participation. Being a Student Leader doesn’t give you an advantage. It’s just a title! If you don’t do any work to back up that title, it really doesn’t mean anything " },{question: "If I’m able to complete all Lessons in the Foundation course by January, do I still need to participate in the #60daysofudacity challenge ", answer: "The challenge is optional so whether you want to participate or not is all up to you! You’re not restricted to just the course material in the challenge, once you’re done with the Foundations course you can move on to study other topics related to Cloud and still have it count for #60daysofudacity 16 Dec AMA " },{question: "When do we create Study groups? ", answer: "You can browse through the study groups that have already been registered and if you are looking for a study group other than that you can always register it through the Study Group Request Form.

" },{question: "Can we join any study groups created? Are there going to be any private study groups too? ", answer: "We will start creating Slack Channels for the Study Groups today, once that is done you will see the ’JOIN’ button against all the study groups get activated in the Study Group Directory and you will be able to join the groups you are interested to be a part of! Regarding private study groups, in case a study group has set up a purpose such that functioning in a private channel is more suitable for them then we can surely help them in creating that only if they reach out to us and let us know about it!

I did it, but the website turned to the same page like the picture below.

There are no links or a provision as such to verify whether you have completed the foundation course, the only way is to do a manual check once you are done with the course. In past scholarships, some of the scholars had volunteered to make a checklist of all modules: quizzes, exercises, lecturers and other things and floated that in the community so that all the scholars could make a copy of it for themselves and use it to make sure they have gone through each and every concept in the course!
